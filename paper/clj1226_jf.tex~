\begin{abstract}
We present pressure profiles of galaxy clusters determined from high resolution 
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect observations of fourteen clusters, which span the
redshift range $ 0.25 < z < 0.89$. 
%We compare our pressure profiles to those from the X-ray data presented by the ACCEPT 
%collaboration, both under the assumption of spherical symmetry. 
The procedure simultaneously fits spherical cluster models to MUSTANG and Bolocam data. In this analysis, 
we adopt the generalized NFW parameterization of pressure profiles to produce our models.
Our constraints on ensemble-average pressure profile parameters, in this study $\gamma$, $C_{500}$, and $P_0$,
are consistent with those in previous studies, but for individual clusters we find discrepancies 
with the X-ray derived pressure profiles from the ACCEPT database. We investigate potential sources of these 
discrepancies, especially cluster geometry, electron temperature of the intracluster medium, and substructure.
We find that the ensemble mean profile for all clusters in our sample is described by the parameters: 
$[\gamma,C_{500},P_0] = [0.3_{-0.1}^{+0.1}, 1.3_{-0.1}^{+0.1}, 7.94_{-0.10}^{+0.10}]$, for cool core clusters: 
$[\gamma,C_{500},P_0] = [0.6_{-0.1}^{+0.1}, 0.9_{-0.1}^{+0.1}, 3.55_{-0.06}^{+0.06}]$,
and for disturbed clusters: 
$[\gamma,C_{500},P_0] = [0.0_{-0.1}^{+0.1}, 1.5_{-0.2}^{+0.1},12.6_{-0.29}^{+0.29}]$.
Three of the fourteen clusters have clear substructure in our SZ observations, while an additional
two clusters exhibit potential substructure.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%\textcolor{red}{Trimming my own notes now.}

Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe and thus serve as ideal cosmological probes 
and astrophysical laboratories. Within a galaxy cluster, the gas in the intracluster medium (ICM) constitutes 90\% of the
baryonic mass \citep{vikhlinin2006b} and is directly observable in the X-ray due to bremsstrahlung emission. 
At millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths, the ICM is observable via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect 
\citep{sunyaev1972}: the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons off of
the hot ICM electrons. The thermal SZ is observed as an intensity decrement relative to the CMB at wavelengths longer 
than $\sim$1.4 mm (frequencies less than $\sim$220 GHz). The amplitude of the thermal SZ is proportional to the integrated
line-of-sight electron pressure, and is often parameterized as Compton $y$: $y = (\sigma_T / m_e c^2) \int P_e dl$, where
$\sigma_T$ is the Thomson cross section, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $P_e$ is the electron
pressure.
%At longer radio wavelengths, if relativistic electrons are present, parts of the ICM may emit synchrotron emission.

%\textcolor{red}{[I need to revise this paragraph.]}
Cosmological constraints derived from galaxy cluster samples are generally limited by the accuracy of mass calibration of 
galaxy clusters \citep[e.g.][]{hasselfield2013, reichardt2013}, which is often calculated via a scaling relation with 
respect to some integrated observable quantity. Scatter in the scaling relations will then depend on the regularity of 
clusters and the adopted integration radius of the clusters. Determining pressure profiles of galaxy clusters provides an 
assessment of the relative impact and frequency of various astrophysical processes in the ICM and can refine the choice of 
extent of galaxy clusters to reduce the scatter in scaling relations.

In the core of a galaxy cluster, some observed astrophysical processes include shocks and cold fronts 
\citep[e.g.][]{markevitch2007}, sloshing \citep[e.g.][]{fabian2006}, and X-ray cavities \citep{mcnamara2007}. 
It is also theorized that helium sedimentation should occur, most noticeably in low redshift, dynamically-relaxed 
clusters \citep{abramopoulos1981, gilfanov1984} 
and recently the expected helium enhancement via sedimentation has been numerically simulated \citep{peng2009}. 
This would result in an offset between X-ray and SZ derived pressure profiles if not accounted for correctly.

At large radii ($R \gtrsim R_{500}$),\footnote{$R_{500}$ is the radius at which the enclosed average mass density is 
500 times the critical density, $\rho_c(z)$, of the universe} equilibration timescales are longer, accretion is ongoing, 
and hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE) is a poor approximation. Several numerical simulations show that the fractional contribution
from non-thermal pressure increases with radius \citep{shaw2010,battaglia2012,nelson2014}. 
For all three studies, non thermal pressure fractions between 15\% and 30\% are found at ($R \sim R_{500}$)
for redshifts $0 < z < 1$. Additionally, clumping is expected to increase with radius \citep{kravtsov2012}, and is expected to
increase the scatter of pressure profiles at large radii \citep{nagai2011} as well as biasing X-ray derived gas density high,
and thus X-ray derived thermal pressure low \citep{battaglia2015}.

However, the intermediate region, between the core and outer regions of the galaxy cluster, 
is often the best region to apply self-similar scaling relations derived from HSE to describe simulations 
and observations \citep[e.g.][]{kravtsov2012}. Moreover, both simulations and observations find low
cluster-to-cluster scatter in pressure profiles within this intermediate radial range \citep[e.g.][]{borgani2004,
nagai2007,arnaud2010,bonamente2012,planck2013a,sayers2013}.

There are many existing facilities capable of making SZ observations, but most have
angular resolutions of one arcminute or larger. In recent years, the SZ community has adopted the pressure profile
presented in \citet{arnaud2010} (hereafter, A10), who derive their pressure profiles from X-ray data from the 
REXCESS sample of 31 nearby ($z < 0.2$) clusters out to $R_{500}$ and numerical simulations for larger radii. The
adoption of the A10 pressure profile has allowed for the extraction of an integrated observable quantity which,
via scaling relations, can then be used to determine the mass of the clusters. In this paper, we use high resolution
SZ data to test the validity of this pressure profile in our sample of 14 clusters at intermediate redshifts.

The MUSTANG camera \citep{dicker2008}
on the 100 meter Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope \citep[GBT, ][]{jewell2004} with its angular resolution of 9\asec 
(full-width, half-maximum FWHM) is one of only a few SZ effect instruments with sub-arcminute resolution.
However, MUSTANG's instantaneous field of view (FOV) limits its sensitivity to scales larger than $1$\amin. 
To probe a wider range of scales we complement our MUSTANG data with SZ data from Bolocam \citep{glenn1998}. 
Bolocam is a 144-element bolometer
array on the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) with a beam FWHM of 58\asecs at 140 GHz and circular FOV with 8\amins 
diameter, which is well matched to the angular size of $R_{500}$ ($\sim 4$\amin) of the clusters in our sample. 

This paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:obs} we describe the MUSTANG and Bolocam observations and reduction. 
In Section~\ref{sec:jointfitting} we review the method used to jointly fit pressure profiles to MUSTANG and Bolocam data. We
present results from the joint fits in Section~\ref{sec:pp_constraints} and compare our results to X-ray derived pressures 
in Section~\ref{sec:xray_comp}. 
Throughout this paper we assume a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\Omega_m = 0.3$, $\Omega_{\lambda} = 0.7$, and $H_0 = 70$ 
km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.
%consistent with the 9-year \emph{Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe} (WMAP) results reported in \cite{hinshaw2013}.

\label{sec:obs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Sample}

Our cluster sample is based primarily on the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) sample, which is a
524-orbit multi-cycle treasury program. 
%One of its main goals is to ``measure the profiles and substructures of dark matter 
%in galaxy clusters with unprecedented precision and resolution'' \citep{postman2012}. 
The CLASH sample has 25 massive galaxy clusters, 20 of which are selected from X-ray data (from \emph{Chandra X-ray Observatory}, 
hereafter \emph{Chandra}), and 5 based on exceptional lensing strength. 
These clusters have the following properties: $0.187 < z < 0.890$, $5.5 < k T_e$ (keV)$ < 15.5$, and $6.7 < L_{bol} / 10^{44} $ 
(erg s$^{-1}$) $<90.8$. Thus, these clusters are large enough that we should expect to detect them with MUSTANG with a reasonable 
amount of time on the sky (on average, $<$25 hours per cluster).

%While these clusters are not a complete sample, many already have SZ effect observations from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich 
%Array (SZA), AMiBA, or Bolocam, making them well studied, and deserving of high resolution SZ effect measurements. 
%The wealth of observations on these clusters will allow us to constrain pressure and 
%mass profiles of clusters as well as the impact of substructure. Additionally, we will be able to assess discrepancies
%between X-ray derived properties, shown in Table~\ref{tbl:cluster_properties} 
%and compare to SZ derived properties.

Of the 25 clusters in the CLASH sample, four are too far south to be observed with MUSTANG from Green Bank, WV.
Of the remaining 21, we were able to observe fourteen given the available good weather and their limited visibility
during the observational campaign from 2008 to 2014.
Abell 209 was observed, but was relatively noisy and showed no trace of any detection. Thus, our final sample
includes thirteen CLASH clusters and Abell 1835, which are shown in bold in Table~\ref{tbl:cluster_properties}. These clusters
were also observed with Bolocam, and have been analyzed in \citet{sayers2012, sayers2013,czakon2015}. The centroid differences
between the \emph{Archive of Chandra Cluster Entropy Profile Tables} \citep[ACCEPT][]{cavagnolo2009}) 
and Bolocam ($\Delta r_0$) are also listed as  in Table~\ref{tbl:cluster_properties}. The total integration times of
MUSTANG and Bolocam observations of our sample is listed in Table~\ref{tbl:cluster_obs}.

\subsection{MUSTANG Observations and Reduction}
\label{sec:musobs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

MUSTANG is a 64 pixel array of Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers arranged in an $8 \times 8$ array
located at the Gregorian focus on the 100 m GBT. Operating at 90 GHz (81--99~GHz),
MUSTANG has an angular resolution of 9\asec and pixel spacing of 0.63$f \lambda$ resulting in a FOV
of 42\asec. More detailed information about the instrument can be found in \citet{dicker2008}.

Our observations and data reduction are described in detail in \citet{romero2015a}, and we briefly review them
here. Absolute flux calibrations are based on the planets Mars, Uranus, or Saturn, nebulae, or the star Betelgeuse 
($\alpha_{Ori}$). At least one of these flux calibrators was observed at least once per night, and we find our 
calibration is accurate to a 10\% RMS uncertainty. We also observe bright point sources every half hour
to track our pointing and beam shape. To observe the target galaxy clusters, we employ Lissajous daisy scans 
with a $3\arcmin$ radius and in many of the clusters we broadened our coverage with a hexagonal pattern of 
daisy centers (with $1\arcmin$ offsets). 
For most clusters, the coverage (weight) drops to 50\% of its peak value at a radius of $1.3\arcmin$.
%'

Processing of MUSTANG data is performed using a custom IDL pipeline. Raw data is recorded as time ordered data (TOD)
from each of the 64 detectors. An outline of the data processing for each scan on a galaxy cluster is given below.
  
  (1) We define a pixel mask from the nearest preceding CAL scan; unresponsive detectors are masked out.
  The CAL scan provides us with unique gains to be applied to each of the responsive detectors.

  (2) A common mode template, polynomial, and sinusoid are fit to the data and then subtracted. The common mode is
  calculated as the arithmetic mean of the TOD across detectors.

  (3) After the common mode and polynomial subtraction each scan is subjected to spike (glitch), skewness, and Allan 
  variance tests and are flagged according to the following criteria. Glitches are flagged as $4\sigma$ excursions based
  on the median absolute deviation; The skewness threshold for flagging is 0.4. Flags based on Allan variance require
  the variance over a two second interval to be greater than 9 times the variance between each integration.

  (4) Individual detector weights are calculated as $1/ \sigma_i^2$, where $\sigma_i$ is the RMS of the non-flagged
  TOD for that detector. 

  (5) Maps are produced by gridding the TOD in 1\asec pixels in Right Ascension (R.A.) and Declination (Dec). A weight 
  map is produced in addition to the signal map.

\subsection{Bolocam Observations and Reduction}
\label{sec:bolocamredox}

Bolocam is a 144-element camera that was a facility instrument on the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) from
2003 until 2012. Its field of view is 8\amins in diameter, and at 140 GHz it has a resolution of 58\asecs FWHM
(\citet{glenn1998,haig2004}). The clusters were observed with a Lissajous pattern that results in a tapered
coverage dropping to 50\% of the peak value at a radius of roughly 5\amin, and to 0 at a radius of 10\amin.
The Bolocam maps used in this analysis are $14\arcmin \times 14\arcmin$. The Bolocam data 
\footnote{Bolocam data is publicaly available at 
\href{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/Planck/release\_2/ancillary-data/bolocam/}
{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/Planck/release\_2/ancillary-data/} 
\href{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/Planck/release\_2/ancillary-data/bolocam/}{bolocam/}.} 
are the same as those used in \citet{czakon2015} and \citet{sayers2013}; the details of the reduction are 
given therein, along with \citet{sayers2011}. 
%Bolocam observed Abell 1835 for 14.0 hours resulting in a noise of 16.2 $\mu K_{CMB}$-arcminute, and observed 
%MACS 0647 for 11.4 hours resulting in a noise of 22.0 $\mu K_{CMB}$-arcminute.
%In addition to the data maps, for each cluster 1000 noise maps are also provided, which
%included relevant sources of instrumental, atmospheric, and astronomical noise. 
The reduction and calibration is similar to that used for MUSTANG, and Bolocam achieves a 
5\% calibration accuracy and 5\asecs pointing accuracy.

\section{Joint Map Fitting Technique}
\label{sec:jointfitting}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sec:jf_overview}

The joint map fitting technique used in this paper is described in detail in \citet{romero2015a}. We review
it briefly here. The general approach follows that of a least squares fitting procedure, which assumes that
we can make a model map as a linear combination of model components. 

This linear combination can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  \vec{d}_m = \mathbf{A} \vec{a}_m,
\end{equation}
where $d_m$ is the total model, each column in $\mathbf{A}$ is a filtered model component (Section~\ref{sec:components}), 
and $\vec{a}_m$ is 
an array of amplitudes of the components. There are up to four types of components for which fit: 
a bulk component, point source(s), residual component(s), and a mean level. Of these, we produce a
sky model for the bulk component and point source to be filtered. The residual component is calculated 
directly as a filtered component.

We wish to fit $\vec{d}_m$ to our data, $\vec{d}$, and allow for a calibration offset between Bolocam and
MUSTANG data. We therefore define our data vector as:
\begin{equation}
  \vec{d} = [ \vec{d}_{B}, k \vec{d}_{M}, k ] ,
\end{equation}
where $\vec{d}_{B}$ is the Bolocam data, $\vec{d}_{M}$ is the MUSTANG data, and $k$ is the calibration offset of
MUSTANG relative to Bolocam, with an RMS uncertainty of 11.2\%.

We use the $\chi^2$ statistic as our goodness of fit:
\begin{equation}
  \chi^2 = (\overrightarrow{d} - \overrightarrow{d}_m)^T \mathbf{N}^{-1} (\overrightarrow{d} - \overrightarrow{d}_m),
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{N}$ is the covariance matrix; however, because we wish to fit for $k$ in addition to the 
amplitude of model components, we no longer have
completely linearly independent variables, and thus we employ MPFIT \citep{markwardt2009} to solve for these
variables.

\subsection{Simulated Observations}
\label{sec:jf_filtering}

Simulated observations are performed by converting an input sky into input TOD and processing the simulated TOD
as the true TOD are processed (Section~\ref{sec:musobs}). The time requirements for simulated observations are  
reduced by storing the necessary telescope and detector information from the true TOD in an IDL structure. 
Due to the time requirements to cover the
necessary parameter space (Section~\ref{sec:param_space}), TOD were produced with a fraction of the scans (termed
short TOD) on a given cluster, where care was taken to ensure the same coverage (relative weight distribution) 
in the map as the full observation. 
The filtering is observed to be the same between full TOD and short TOD (Figure~\ref{fig:long_vs_short_qv}). 

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/Long_vs_short_qv_bestfit_m0647_22_Jun_2015_v2.eps}
  \caption{A fitted model to MACS 0647. The scatter in the short TOD is $\lesssim 3$\% 
    of the peak Compton $y$. In absolute terms, this translates to roughly $2\times 10^{-5}$ in Compton $y$. 
    Typical pixel noise in maps is 7 to 8 times greater.}
  \label{fig:long_vs_short_qv}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Components}
\label{sec:components}

\subsubsection{Bulk ICM}
\label{sec:bulk_ICM}

 As in \citet{romero2015a}, the bulk component is taken to be a 
spherically symmetric 3D electron pressure profile as parameterized by a generalized Navarro, Frenk,
and White profile \citep[hereafter, gNFW][]{navarro1997,nagai2007}:
\begin{equation}
  \Tilde{P} = \frac{P_0}{(C_{500} X)^{\gamma} [1 + (C_{500} X)^{\alpha}]^{(\beta - \gamma)/\alpha}}
\end{equation}
where $X = R / R_{500}$, and $C_{500}$ is the concentration parameter; one can also write ($C_{500} X$) as
($R / R_s$), where $R_s = R_{500}/C_{500}$. $\Tilde{P}$ is the electron pressure in units of the characteristic
pressure $P_{500}$. This pressure profile is integrated along the line of sight to produce 
a Compton $y$ profile, given as 
\begin{equation}
  y(r) = \frac{P_{500} \sigma_{T}}{m_e c^2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Tilde{P}(r,l) dl
\end{equation}
where $R^2 = r^2 + l^2$, $r$ is the projected radius, and $l$ is the distance from the center of the cluster
along the line of sight. Once integrated, $y(r)$ is gridded as $y(\theta)$ and is realized as two maps with
the same astrometry as the MUSTANG and Bolocam data maps (pixels of 1\asecs and 20\asecs on a side, respectively). 
%From here, we produce two model maps: one for Bolocam and one for MUSTANG. 
In each case, we convolve the Compton $y$ map by the appropriate beam shape. For Bolocam we use a Gaussian with FWHM
$= 58$\asec, and for MUSTANG we use the double Gaussian as determined in \citet{romero2015a}.

\subsubsection{Point Sources}
\label{sec:ptsrcs}

Point sources are treated in the same manner as in \citet{romero2015a}. All compact sources in our sample
are well modelled as a point source. We clearly detect point sources in Abell 1835, MACS 1115, MACS 0429, 
MACS 1206, RXJ1347, MACS 1423, and MACS 0717 in the MUSTANG maps. A point source is identified by NIKA 
\citep{adam2015} in CLJ1226, which is posited to be a submillimeter galaxy (SMG) behind the cluster. 
The point source in MACS 0717 is due to a foreground elliptical galaxy \citep{mroczkowski2012}.
All of the remaining point sources (six) are coincident (within 3\asecs of reported coordinnates) with the BCGs 
of their respective clusters \citep[][]{crawford1999,donahue2015}. 
%%%%%%% Suggestion to rewrite this text:
Moreover, of these six BCGs, four of them exhibit \quotes{unambiguous UV excess} \citep{donahue2015}. 
The remaining two are Abell 1835 and MACS 1206. The UV excess in MACS 1206 may be due to lensed
background systems \citep{donahue2015}. Abell 1835 is not in the CLASH sample and thus was not
included in \citet{donahue2015}. However, it was observed by \citet{odea2010} and found to have a 
FUV flux corresponding to a star formation rate of 11.7 $M_{\odot}$ per year, which fits within the SFR range 
(5 - 80 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) of the UV excess BCGs found in \citep{donahue2015}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
For the Bolocam image, the point sources in Abell 1835, MACS 0429, RXJ1347, and MACS 1423
have been subtracted based on an extrapolation of a power law fit to the 1.4 GHz NVSS \citep{condon1998}
and 30 GHz SZA \citep{mroczkowski2009} measurements \citep{sayers2012}. The flux densities for
the point sources fitted are shown in Table~\ref{tbl:sample_ptsrc}.

  $S_{140} (\text{mJy/bm}) \sim S_{140} / 30 (\mu\text{K}_{CMB})$.}
\end{deluxetable}

\subsubsection{Residual Components}

Residual components are selected primarily as $4 \sigma$ decrements within the central arcminute of MUSTANG maps,
which are not well fitted by a bulk model. We fit residual components for MACS 1206, RXJ 1347, and MACS 0744.
Although we do not fit for residual components in Abell 611 and MACS 1115, we report properties of potential
residual components for these two clusters. We do not fit the residual component for Abell 611 because the peak
significance is not $4\sigma$ and the bulk cluster model appears to account for much of the decrement. For MACS 1115, 
the residual component is outside the central arcminute and does not affect our fit.

To create the residual component, we first select the feature of interest based on the MUSTANG signal-to-noise (SNR) map
of the cluster \citep[see][]{romero2015a}. All pixels below $-3 \sigma$ pertaining to the feature are selected, and the 
shape is determined by fitting a two dimensional Gaussian. This Gaussian is then fit to the unsmoothed MUSTANG data map 
(in units of Compton $y$), where only its amplitude is allowed to vary.

\subsubsection{Mean Level}
\label{sec:mean_level}

%%% JSayers: Bolocam too? Yes...if done, both are done. But I removed the mean level fit in the simple sense.
%%% I don´t think I fit out a Bolocam mean level, because it was so low.
Similar to \citet{czakon2015}, we wish to account for a mean level (signal offset) in the MUSTANG maps.
We do not wish to fit for a mean level simultaneously as a bulk component given the degeneracies. Therefore,
to determine the mean level independent of the other components, we create a MUSTANG noise map
% from time-flipped TOD 
and calculate the mean within the inner arcminute for each cluster. This mean is then subtracted before 
the other components are fit. 

\subsection{Parameter Space}
\label{sec:param_space}

As in \citet{romero2015a}, we fix MUSTANG's centroid, but allow Bolocam's pointing to vary by $\pm 10$\asecs 
in RA and Dec with a prior on Bolocam's radial pointing accuracy with an RMS uncertainty of $5$\asec. Our 
approach to find the absolute calibration offset between Bolocam and MUSTANG is the same as in
\citet{romero2015a} (see also Section~\ref{sec:jf_overview}). 

In \citet{romero2015a}, we performed a grid search over $\gamma$ and $C_{500}$, marginalizing over $P_0$,
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are fixed to values determined from previous studies. We find that fixing
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ at different values, the pressure profiles are in very 
good agreement with one another and that the 
differences in $\chi^2$ values between these fits is not significant. Thus, for our fits 
we assume the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ given in \citetalias{arnaud2010}.

We search over $0 < \gamma < 1.3$ in steps of $\delta \gamma = 0.1$, and over
$0.1 < C_{500} < 3.3$ in steps of $\delta C_{500} = 0.1$. To create models in finer steps than $\delta \gamma$ 
and $\delta C_{500}$, we interpolate filtered model maps from nearest neighbors from the grid of original 
filtered models. 

\subsubsection{Centroid}

The default centroids used when gridding our bulk ICM component are the ACCEPT centroids. Given the offsets
between ACCEPT and Bolocam centroids (Table~\ref{tbl:cluster_properties}), we perform a second set of
fits where we grid the bulk ICM component using the Bolocam centroids. The ACCEPT centroid are taken to be the
X-ray peaks unless their centroiding algorithm produced a centroid more than 70 kpc from the X-ray peak, in which
case they adopt that centroid \citep{cavagnolo2008a}. 
%We do not find significant changes in
%the fitted gNFW parameters (Section~\ref{sec:pp_constraints}), 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{SZ Pressure Profile Constraints}
\label{sec:pp_constraints}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We have constrained the gNFW parameters $P_0$, $C_{500}$, and $\gamma$ for fourteen individual clusters. 
Given that we find minimal differences between the fitted parameters for ACCEPT centroids and Bolocam centroids, 
we report the results using the ACCEPT centroids in Table~\ref{tbl:pressure_profile_results}.
%We find that six of the fourteen clusters are best fit by $\gamma = 0$. 
We find that six of our sample of fourteen have a best fit $\gamma = 0$, where we do not allow $\gamma <0$. 
We find that our range of $C_{500}$ is sufficient, and that it is generally found to be $0.5 < C_{500} < 2.0$. 

For each cluster, we compare our SZ-derived pressure profiles with X-ray derived pressure profiles from ACCEPT 
\citep{cavagnolo2009}. Specifically, we fit gNFW profiles to the deprojected pressure profiles of individual 
clusters and ensembles of clusters, described further in Section~\ref{sec:ellgeo}. We adopt C09 to refer to the 
ensemble pressure profiles fit to ACCEPT data for our sample of 14 clusters. 
In our comparison, we find discrepancies in pressure profiles of individual galaxy 
clusters as derived from MUSTANG and Bolocam to those fitted to ACCEPT data. 
Despite this, the pressure profile found over all clusters 
has very similar parameters to those found using X-ray data in \citet{arnaud2010}.  This can also be seen in 
Figure~\ref{fig:pp_sets},where the A10 pressure profile is consistently close to the profile from this work (R16). 
While all 14 clusters in this work are in \citet{sayers2013} (hereafter S13), they find a consistently higher 
universal pressure profile. \citet{planck2013a} (hereafter P13) find higher pressure at large radii and lower 
pressure at small radii compared to our and the pressure profiles foind in \citetalias{arnaud2010}.

\end{figure}

% Now I want to compare to A10, P13, S13? OK...this is done.
%%% What else to say?

While our stacked pressure profiles are in excellent agreement with the previously derived pressure profiles
in the region $0.1 R_{500} < r < R_{500}$, we see deviations at small and large radii. It is not too surprising
that our fits agree with A10 at large radii, as we have fixed $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to the A10 values. Despite our
fourteen clusters being included in the BOXSZ sample \citep{sayers2013}, we see that S13 shows higher pressure
at all radii. We note that S13 presents a higher pressure at small radii than found in this work, where the
addition of MUSTANG data contributes significantly to constraining the pressure at small radii (towards smaller
pressures). At larger radii, our restriction of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ again explain our reduced pressure relative
to S13.

Figure~\ref{fig:ppr_ensembles} shows the ratios of the pressure profiles derived from this work to those from 
other works, when clusters are characterized by dynamical type. We calculate these average ratios by weighting 
the ratios of individual clusters, where the specific fitted gNFW pressure profile for
each cluster is taken for ACCEPT, but for the other sets (A10, P13, and S13), we assume the gNFW profile 
found for all clusters in their sample. In fitting profiles to ACCEPT, we impose the same restriction on 
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ (fixing them to A10 values). In this manner, this imposition no longer biases our results
at large radii, and we consistently see higher pressures at large radii in the SZ as compared to X-ray (ACCEPT) 
data. 
%\textcolor{red}{I also started thinking about \emph{XMM-Newton} vs. \emph{Chandra} data. However,
%\citet{donahue2014} would indicate that \emph{XMM-Newton} data tends to be lower in $n_e$ and $T_e$, which is
%\textbf{opposite} what we see in C09 vs. A10.}

%%% Look at Jack´s comments. 

Shallow slopes in the cores of clusters could be suggestive of a centroid offset either between MUSTANG and Bolocam or
between SZ and X-ray data. Given the MUSTANG and Bolocam pointing accuracies (2\asec and 5\asec, respectively),
it is unlikely that the centroid offsets between MUSTANG and Bolocam are driving the fits to shallow slopes. 
The difference between
SZ (Bolocam) centroids and ACCEPT (Table~\ref{tbl:cluster_properties}) are large relative to pointing accuracies
and thus potentially more important. However, when we adopt Bolocam's centroid 
%(\textcolor{red}{[Is this worth another figure? I'm OK without another figure for this.]}) 
we find negligible change to the SZ pressure profile as compared to adopting the ACCEPT centroid. 

Individually, the Bolocam and MUSTANG data sets yield consistent fits with each other, where changes in best fit 
parameters generally occur along the shallow gradient in confidence intervals (i.e. along the degeneracy
between  $C_{500}$, and $\gamma$).

Additionally, we consider the impact of the assumed flux densities of point sources in the Bolocam maps. 
There are four clusters where Bolocam assumes a point source flux density: Abell 1835, MACS 0429, RXJ 1347, and MACS 1423. 
The conversion for $S_{140}$ values from mJy to the equivalent $\mu K_{CMB-amin}$ 
is $\sim30$, which puts the uncertainties of these point sources at 6, 52, 35, and 6 $\mu K_{CMB-amin}$ respectively. 
From Table~\ref{tbl:cluster_obs}, we see that the noise in the Bolocam maps of these clusters are 16.2, 24.1, 19.7, 
and 22.3 $\mu K_{CMB-amin}$ respectively. Thus, for MACS 0429 and RXJ 1347, which have point source flux density 
uncertainties larger than the measurement noise, the assumed point sources could have a noticeable impact on the cluster
fits. However, the detection of the cluster decrement in RXJ 1347 is much stronger than that of MACS 0429 
(Table~\ref{tbl:cluster_obs}), thus likely to impact RXJ 1347 less.

Only two of the four clusters (Abell 1835, MACS 0429, RXJ 1347, and MACS 1423) are fit by notably low $\gamma$ values.
By extension, the remaining four clusters in which MUSTANG detects a point source, but Bolocam had not assumed a 
(nonzero) point source flux density, only MACS 0717 is fit by a notably low $\gamma$, and that is best attributed
to the dynamics of the cluster (Section~\ref{sec:results_m0717}). 

As it stands, finding slopes in the cores of galaxy clusters that are fit with $\gamma = 0$ is not unprecedented; 
\citetalias{arnaud2010} find six of their 31 analyzed clusters in the REXCESS sample have $\gamma=0$, where all gNFW parameters 
except $\beta$ were fit for individual clusters. They find a similar range in $C_{500}$ as we do, They fit for $\alpha$, 
which is fit by the range $0.3 < \alpha < 2.5$ over their sample. While \citetalias{arnaud2010} is a local ($z < 0.2$) sample,
\citet{mantz2016} find $\gamma=-0.01$, using \emph{Chandra} data, for their sample of 40 galaxy clusters of $0.07 < z < 1.10$.
Moreover, in a joint analysis of SZ (South Pole Telescope) and X-ray (\emph{Chandra}) data from observations of 80 clusters, 
\citet{mcdonald2014} find $\gamma=0$ for their low redshift ($0.3 < z < 0.6$), non-cool-core clusters, and similarly shallow 
inner pressure profile slope ($\gamma=0.05$) for the high redshift ($0.6 < z < 1.2$) non-cool-core clusters.
Given our analysis and care to not be biased towards $\gamma=0$ and the precedence for other studies to find $\gamma=0$ in
either individual clusters or cluster ensembles, we conclude that our study is not systematically biased towards $\gamma = 0$.

%The sample in \citet{arnaud2010} is a local ($z < 0.2$), flux limited sample, and for their analysis, 
%they have excluded two clusters (a supercluster, Abell 901/902, 
%and a bimodal cluster, RXC J2157.4-0747) from the full REXCESS sample of 33 clusters. \citet{sayers2013} 
%determined pressure profile parameters over a sample of 45 clusters with the redshift range $0.15 < z < 0.89$, 
%where most (60\%) lie between $0.35 < z < 0.59$. They fit profiles to the stack of deprojected pressure 
%profiles, restricting $C_{500}$ to the A10 value, and fit for the other gNFW parameters.

\section{Integrated Compton $Y$ Scaling Relations}

%\textcolor{red}{I need to introduce integrated Y a bit more I think.}

We calculate integrated Compton $Y$ values at $R_{500}$ due to the expected minimal scatter at intermediate 
radii \citep[e.g.][]{kravtsov2012}. We use $R_{500}$ derived from X-ray observations \citep{mantz2010}, 
and calculate $Y_{sph}$, given by:
\begin{equation}
  Y_{sph}(R) = \frac{\sigma_T}{m_e c^2} \int_0^R P_e(r') 4 \pi r'^2 dr' 
  \label{eqn:ysph}
\end{equation}
and $Y_{cyl}$, which is given by:
\begin{equation}
  Y_{cyl}(R) = \frac{\sigma_T}{m_e c^2} \int_0^R  2 \pi r dr \int_r^{R_b} \frac{2 r' P_e(r') dr'}{\sqrt{r'^2 - r^2}},
  \label{eqn:ycyl}
\end{equation}
where we adopt $R_b = R_{500}$ as in \citetalias{arnaud2010}.
The error bars on $Y_{sph}(R_{500})$ and $Y_{cyl}(R_{500})$ are found by calculating the respective quantities 
from the pressure profile fits over the 1000 noise realizations, and taking the values encompassing the middle 68\%. 
We take $M_{500}$ from \citet{mantz2010}, who 
calculate it in the following steps: (1) calculating $M_{gas,2500}$, the total gas mass enclosed in $R_{2500}$ from 
deprojected gas mass (non-parametric) profiles, (2) calculating $R_{500}$ by a ratio of 
$R_{500} / R_{2500} \sim 2.3$ assuming an NFW profile with concentration parameter $c=4$, and (3) calculating to 
$M_{500}$ as $\frac{4 \pi 500 \rho_{cr}(z) r_{500}^3}{3(1+B)}$, where $B = 0.03 \pm 0.06$ is a systematic fractional 
bias. \citet{mantz2010} note that the dominant source of systematic uncertainty associated with $M_{500}$ comes 
from the uncertainty in the assumed $f_{gas}(r_{2500}) = 0.1104$. 

We compare our $Y_{sph}(R_{500}) - M_{500}$ relation to that of A10 in Figure~\ref{fig:ysph_scaling}.
The $Y_{sph} - M_{500}$ scaling relation calculated in \citetalias{arnaud2010} is given as:
\begin{equation}
%  h(z)^{-2/3} Y_{sph}(x R_{500}) = A_x \left{[}\frac{M_{500}}{3 \times 10^{14} h_{70}^{-1} M_{\odot}} \right{]}^{\alpha} ,
  h(z)^{-2/3} Y_{sph}(x R_{500}) = A_x \left[ \frac{M_{500}}{3 \times 10^{14} h_{70}^{-1} M_{\odot}} \right] ^{\alpha} ,
  \label{eqn:ysph_scaling}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha = 1.78$, $A_X = 2.925 \times 10^{-5} I(x) h_{70}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^2$, and $I(1) = 0.6145$.
and find six of fourteen clusters which are more than $2 \sigma$ in $Y_{sph}$ from the scaling relation.
When we consider the mass uncertainty, that number drops to three. While our sample size is small, the
tendency of cool core clusters to lie above the scaling relation and of disturbed clusters to lie below the
scaling relation is interesting. Regardless of cluster type, our sample does show a more shallow $Y_{sph,500}-M_{500}$ slope
($1.06\pm0.13$) than the predicted self similar slope ($5/3$) or $1.78$ found in \citetalias{arnaud2010}. 
This is consistent with the slope found for the BOXSZ sample by \citet{czakon2015} for $Y_{cyl,2500} - M_{2500}$ of $1.06\pm0.12$.

% I can talk about a shallower slope...but then I should fit a slope to our data. Ugh...OK, that probably is good to do.
% Also Y_cyl - M_500.

%\textcolor{red}{I am still thinking about potential biases / if the tendencies of CC clusters above the scaling relation and
%disturbed clusters below the scaling relation is significant.}

%\textcolor{red}{The bias of the (two) cool core clusters above the scaling relation is fundamentally caused by the shallower
%slope at large radii for these two clusters. The only way to achieve a shallow slope at larger radii with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ 
%fixed is then to drive $C_{500}$ to low values (and keep $\gamma$ relatively low too). We, in fact, see this. MACS 1311 and MACS
%0429, the two ``offending'' clusters, have two of the three lowest $C_{500}$ values, where MACS 1115 has the lowest, but is also
%fit with a relatively high $\gamma$ value. The question then becomes, what is driving the pressure high at larger radii? And
%subsequently, is it just coincidence that these two clusters are cool core clusters? 
%Or colloquially, \emph{what's up with that?}.
%Finally, with only four disturbed clusters, one of which is also a cool core cluster, it's tempting to see the reverse trend -
%that disturbed clusters are falling below the relation, and cool core clusters are falling above the scaling relation. I'm less
%inclined to make a point of this, but perhaps it's worth mentioning.}

%\textcolor{red}{I would suspect the source of elevated pressure at large radii is largely assymetries seen at these larger radii. 
%That is, looking at the maps with X-ray and Bolocam contours, we see extended pressure, 
%which is not strictly circular about the [either] centroid. A
%gain, on centroids, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:pp_error}, there is generally not a significant difference in 
%fitted parameters, and specifically for these two clusters, there is visually \textbf{no} difference when comparing fits 
%(i.e. confidence intervals) using the ACCEPT centroid to the fits using the Bolocam centroid. 
%Thus, I have to return to the notion that there \textbf{is} some
%pressure that SZ observations are finding at large radii that the X-ray observations are not. This higher pressure is not seen
%globally (it's not symmetrically present), but arises assymetrically and could be due to locally elevated temperatures at large
%radii, to which X-rays are not sensitive.}

%\textcolor{red}{I wonder if this tendency is not seen in X-ray data as much simply because exposure times for cool core clusters
%may be restricted. That is, perhaps the cost to measure the pressure at these radii is too much for what proposers have expected
%to find, especially when they can constrain the pressure profile in the core very well in a much shorter time, relative to what
%would be required for these larger radii.}

\section{Combining SZ and X-ray Data}
\label{sec:xray_comp}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The observed SZ and X-ray signal from galaxy clusters differ in their 
dependence upon the physical properties in the intracluster medium (ICM). This difference
has, in the past, been exploited to make calculations of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, 
assuming spherical geometry of galaxy clusters. However, one can relax the spherical assumption
and use the differences in SZ and X-ray inferred quantities to calculate cluster elongation
along the line of sight, helium sedimentation, or (recalculate) the ICM electron temperature.
These are all degenerate (i.e. these can not all be independently constrained). We investigate
each constraint individually, and conclude that differences in the SZ and X-ray spherically derived
pressure profiles are due to some combination cluster elongation and ICM temperature distribution.

When we assume the X-ray derived temperatures, we find most clusters to be elongated along the line of sight,
which is perhaps a result of the CLASH selection. If, on the other hand, we assume the clusters are
spherical, then our SZ data combined with ACCEPT data imply temperatures systematically higher than
X-ray derived temperatures (this augmentation occurs at larger radii).

%with a geometric mean of $2.7$.
%%% Add some general discussion of SZ vs. ACCEPT?

\subsection{Ellipsoidal Geometry}
\label{sec:ellgeo}

The geometry of a cluster along the line of sight can be calculated by comparing SZ and
X-ray pressure profiles.  We assume azimuthal symmetry in the plane of the sky and elongation/
compression along the line of sight with an axis ratio $c$. 
The X-ray signal is proportional to $n_e^2 \Lambda_{ee}(T_e,Z)$,
where $Z$ is the abundance of heavy elements and $\Lambda_{ee}$ is the X-ray cooling function, 
while SZ signal is proportional to $n_e T_e$.
We make the simplifying assumption that we can concern ourselves solely with the electron distributions
as determined by SZ and X-ray observations ($n_{e,SZ}$ and $n_{e,X}$ respectively)
so that we find $n_{e,SZ} / n_{e,X} = c^{1/2}$. If the temperature distribution determined by ACCEPT is
assumed to be true, then we have $P_{e,SZ} / P_{e,X} = c^{1/2}$

%We take $n_e$ as the true electron density, and let 
%it be a function of ellipsoidal radius, $E^2 = \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2}$, 
%and $\rho = \sqrt{\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2}}$ is the radius in the plane of the sky.
%We take our observable as $O(\rho) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} Q(\rho, z) dz$, with $Q(\rho, z)$ being our source function.
%For the spherical case (subscripted with $S$), we assume $a=b=c=1$. In finding the geometry along the line
%of sight, we allow $c$ to vary, but keep $a=b=1$. Given the our observable is fixed,
%we have $Q_s(\rho, z) = Q(\rho, z) / c$. For X-ray observations, our source function has the proportionality
%$Q_X \propto n_e^2 \Lambda_{ee}(T_e,Z)$, where $Z$ is the abundance of heavy elements, while for SZ, the source function 
%has the proportionality $Q_{SZ} \propto n_e T_e$. 

%We define $\eta = \frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{c}$. 
%We define $\eta = c^{-1}$, thus prolate clusters (along the line of sight) have $\eta < 1$.
%Noting that $\eta$ should be independent of $r$,
%we see that it can be ascertained through the normalization of the electron density profiles,
%or similarly, the electron pressure profiles: $\frac{P_{e,SZ}}{P_{e,X}} = \eta^{-1/2}$. 
%We can sum this up as saying that a prolate cluster (along
%the line of sight, $\eta < 1$) will yield greater pressure as derived from SZ than from X-ray,
%whereas an oblate cluster (along the line of sight) will do the opposite.

To estimate the ellipticity of clusters, we fit the ACCEPT pressure profiles with
a gNFW pressure profile, with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ fixed at their A10 values: 1.05 and 5.49,
respectively. 
%These are tabulated in Table~\ref{tbl:accept_gnfw}. 
The resultant gNFW profile
is then integrated along the line of sight (LOS) to create a Compton $y$ map, and then filtered as 
discussed in \citet{romero2015a}. We use amplitude of the ACCEPT model fitted to Bolocam data
$P_{Bolo}$ to estimate the geometry of the cluster.
The axis ratio is calculated as $c = P_{Bolo}^{2}$, and its associated uncertainty
is calculated as 
$\sigma_{c}^2 = 4 P_{Bolo}^{4} ((\sigma_{Bolo}/P_{Bolo})^2 + (\sigma_{B}/P_{B})^2 + (\sigma_{A}/P_{A})^2)$, 
where $(\sigma_{B}/P_{B}) = 0.05$ and $(\sigma_{A}/P_{A}) = 0.10$ 
are the calibration uncertainties of Bolocam and ACCEPT respectively. 
Table~\ref{tbl:accept_gnfw} presents relevant fitted gNFW parameters used in calculating
the cluster geometry; some of the $c$ values we find to be implausible, but are tabulated nonetheless.

The CLASH sample contains X-ray (20) and lensing (5) selected clusters and was not explicitly designed to
be orientation unbiased. It is, therefore, not too surprising that we find indications that many of the clusters 
in our sample are elongated along the line of sight ($c > 1$).
Abell 1835 is not in the CLASH sample, but is a notably well studied cool core cluster, i.e. it is the subject 
of many studies on the basis of its cool core.

This investigation has made the assumption that the geometry of a given cluster is globally consistent.
That is, one ellipsoidal geometry applies to all regions of the cluster. However, this need not be the
case. The cluster should appear more spherical towards the center, where baryons have
condensed \citep[e.g.][and references therein]{kravtsov2012}. Also, the DM and baryonic distributions
need not align (one need only look at the Bullet cluster \citep{Markevitch2004} for a dramatic example).
This is not a particular concern to this analysis as we are comparing quantities based on the baryonic
distribution, but would be more of a concern when including lensing. 

One way to infer a difference in geometries between the inner and outer regions is to use the (multiplicative) calibration
offset between Bolocam and MUSTANG in our fits. In almost all cases, we find that $k$ tends to be inversely related to 
$P_{Bolo}$, which suggests that the central pressure distribution is more spherical than the outer pressure distribution, 
as shown in Table~\ref{tbl:accept_gnfw}, under $\Delta k$($\sigma$). However, we must attempt to account for the true
calibration offset. Taking our values from Table~\ref{tbl:pressure_profile_results} to be our best estimate of the true
calibration offset, we calculate $\Delta k$($\sigma$) using the uncertainty prior of $12$\% and modulate the
sign such that positive $\Delta k$($\sigma$) indicates that the core is more spherical than the cluster at large scales.

%A simple, but not very robust, estimate of this significance of the signature
%is found by comparing to the calibration offset values found in Table~\ref{tbl:pressure_profile_results}, and
%finding those clusters that show a preference in $\Delta k$ towards a more spherical center. Recalling that $k$ 
%has a prior on it of $12$\%, we can calculate significances shown in Table~\ref{tbl:accept_gnfw}.

\subsection{Temperature profiles}
\label{sec:temp_profiles}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If we assume a given geometry (known ellipticity), then instead of solving for the ellipticity, we can
derive a temperature profile, making use of the direct pressure constraints from SZ observations and the
electron density constraints from X-ray observations. That is, we calculate
\begin{equation}
  T_{e} = \frac{P_{SZ}}{n_{e,X}},
  \label{eqn:telec}
\end{equation}
where $P_{SZ}$ is the pressure derived from pressure profile fits to the SZ data (Section~\ref{sec:pp_constraints}) and
$n_{e,X}$ is the deprojected electron density derived from X-ray data by the ACCEPT collaboration.
For each bin, we assign radial values as the arithmetic mean of its radial bounds.
%(i.e. $r = (r_i + r_{i+1})/2$), where $r_i$ are the bounds between bins.
Binned values of $P_{SZ}$ are then calculated from the fitted gNFW profile for each radial value 
for the corresponding bins used for $n_{e,X}$.

%may lead to more accurate than that found solely by X-rays, depending on
%the quality of both data sets. 
%X-rays do not constrain electron temperature as well as electron density because
%of the scaling in emission, and foremost because of the photon count requirement for X-ray spectra used to derive 
%a temperature from X-rays, which effectively provides lower resolution temperature data, especially at larger radii.
%Thus, combining the SZ derived pressure and X-ray derived electron density makes use of the strength of each data
%set.

We consider two models to describe temperature profiles in the literature: those in
\citet{vikhlinin2006}, denoted as V06 and \citet{bulbul2010}, denoted as B10. The first is given as:
\begin{equation}
  T_{e,V06} = \frac{[(r / r_{cool})^{a_{cool}} + T_{min}/T_0]}{(r / r_{cool})^{a_{cool}} + 1} \times
             \frac{T_0}{(r/r_t)^a [1 + (r/r_t)^b]^{c/b}}
  \label{eqn:tvik06}
\end{equation}
where $r_{cool}$ is a fitted parameter, indicated the radial scale of the cool core, $r_t$ is a transitional radius,
which has been called a scaling radius in other profiles (e.g. NFW). $T_{min}$ is the minimum temperature observed
within the cool core. The remaining parameters, $a_{cool}$, $a$, $b$, $c$, and $T_0$ are all fit for. The first term
in the V06 model (Equation~\ref{eqn:tvik06}) is denoted as the cool core taper:
\begin{equation}
  t_{cool} = \frac{[(r / r_{cool})^{a_{cool}} + T_{min}/T_0]}{(r / r_{cool})^{a_{cool}} + 1}
  \label{eqn:cc_taper}
\end{equation}
The second term in the V06 model (Equation~\ref{eqn:tvik06}) has the form of a gNFW profile, where typically Greek letters
are used for the gNFW pressure profiles (Section~\ref{sec:components}). The letter equivalents
are $a = \gamma$, $b = \alpha$, and $c = \beta - \gamma$. Given that for our pressure profile analysis, 
we fix $\alpha$ and $\beta$ from A10 values, here we fix $b$ and $c$ in fitting for the V06 temperature model, 
where we calculate $c$ and $r_T= R_{500}/C_{500}$ 
based on the best fit $\gamma$ and $C_{500}$ values from our joint fits (Section~\ref{sec:components}). 
Thus, in the temperature profile, we fit for $T_0$, $r_{cool}$, and $a_{cool}$, and $a$.

The other temperature model \citep{bulbul2010} is given as:
\begin{equation}
  T_{e,B10} = T_0 \left[ \frac{1}{(\beta - 2)} \frac{(1+ r/r_s)^{\beta-2} - 1}{r/r_s (1 + r/r_s)^{\beta-2}}\right] t_{cool}
  \label{eqn:tbul10}
\end{equation}
where $T_0$ and parameters in $t_{cool}$ are the only parameters specific to the temperature profile (independent of
pressure or density profile). $\beta$ is a power law term in a generalized NFW profile proposed in \citet{bulbul2010}:
\begin{equation}
  \rho_{tot}(r) = \frac{\rho_i}{(r/r_s)(1+r/r_s)^{\beta}}
  \label{eqn:bulgnfw}
\end{equation}
This formulation of density allows for an analytical formulation of $P(r)$ under the assumption of hydrostatic 
equilibrium. With the assumption of a polytropic equation of state ($P = k \rho_g^{n+1}$, where $k$ is simply a
constant, and $n$ is the polytropic index), the temperature profile (Equation~\ref{eqn:tbul10}) can be derived.
It is worth noting that Equation~\ref{eqn:tbul10} does not diverge at $\beta = 2$.
% and can be calculated from L'Hopital's rule. 
As with $r_t$ in the V06 model, we fix $r_s = R_{500}/C_{500}$ based on our fitted value of $C_{500}$ 
(Section~\ref{sec:pp_constraints}).

We use MPFIT \citep{markwardt2009} to solve for the free parameters in the two temperature profiles. For the
V06 model, we fit for  $r_{cool}$, $a_{cool}$, $T_0$, and $a$, while for the B10 model we fit for $r_{cool}$, $a_{cool}$, 
$T_0$, and $\beta$.

The results of our SZ and X-ray derived temperature profiles are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tprofs_all}. 
We noted that the V06 model typically performs worse than B10 in our fits. This can be
attributed to fixing $b$ and $c$ (especially $c$) as these are fixed power laws that incorporate the
behavior of $n_e$ with radius. More generally, there is a tendency for our derived temperatures
to be larger than the spectroscopically derived temperatures from ACCEPT.

\subsection{Discussion: Differences Between SZ- and X-ray- Derived Quantities}

Given the degeneracy between the geometry of the cluster and temperature, as calculated here, it is most probable
that the difference between SZ and X-ray pressure profiles is due to a combination of the ICM temperatures and
cluster geometries, as well as additional deviations from ellipsoidal symmetry of electron density and temperature. 
Accounting for geometry as calculated in Section~\ref{sec:ellgeo}, we find that there are some clusters that still 
appear discrepant with ACCEPT, particularly those whose pressure falls below ACCEPT's pressure towards the center, 
but above ACCEPT's pressure at larger radii. Dividing these pressure profiles by ACCEPT's electron density, we see
the same trend in temperature profile: lower temperatures in the center, and higher temperatures are larger radii 
relative to ACCEPT.

Clumping is expected to increase with radius, and thus may account for some of the discrepancy between our inferred 
temperature and the X-ray spectroscopically derived temperatures. \citet{battaglia2015} find that clumping
is more pronounced for more massive clusters and for the most massive range considered, which is most applicable to our
sample, the density clumping ($C_{2,\rho} = \langle \rho^2 \rangle / \langle \rho \rangle ^2$) at $R_{500}$ is roughly 1.2. 
Such a clumping factor can account for $\sim5$\% discrepancy between the SZ/X-ray and X-ray spectroscopically derived 
temperatures. However, the discrepancies we find are well within $R_{500}$, and therefore we do not consider that clumping
is a contributing factor to temperature discrepancies.

Merger activity may also address some of the discrepancies which we find. Interestingly, in RXJ 1347 and MACS 0744, where shocks
have been observed \citep{kitayama2004,mason2010,korngut2011}, and residual components fit (Section~\ref{sec:jointfitting}), 
our temperature profiles are in good agreement with the spectroscopic X-ray temperature profiles. However, the triple
merging cluster MACS 0717 (Section~\ref{sec:results_m0744}) does not present a clear shock in SZ or X-ray and has a notable
enhancement of SZ/X-ray temperature over the spectroscopic temperature in the center. Another cluster, MACS 1149, suspected of
undergoing a merger
(Section~\ref{sec:results_m1149}), has a enhancement in SZ/X-ray temperature and then tends towards the spectroscopic temperature,
but it is far less pronounced than in MACS 0717 and it occurs at a larger radius. Thus, perhaps merger activity is also
responsible for discrepancies present in other clusters where a possible disturbance is noted.

While the ICM of our clusters may deviate from being smooth and spherical, the potential deviations discussed here do not,
in our estimation, account for some of largest discrepancies. Therefore, we find it implausible that the temperature is in 
some cases twice that found by ACCEPT, especially those inferred values of $k_B T_e \gtrsim 15$ keV.

% a $\sim20$\% increase of temperature higher relative to ACCEPT at $R_{500}$ would be consistent with simulations.

%the square root of pressure clumping ($C_{2,P}$),
%given by $C_{2,P} = \langle P_{th}^2 \rangle / \langle P_{th} \rangle ^2$, is roughly 1.2, and the square root of mass
%density clumping ($C_{2,\rho}$), given by $C_{2,\rho} = \langle \rho^2 \rangle / \langle \rho \rangle ^2$, is roughly 1.1.

%Some cases, especially
%(Figure~\ref{fig:CI_all}) %% This figure is found in pressure_profiles.tex (in thesis).
%MACS 0717 and MACS 1149, are likely due to their known merging status. Others, like MACS 1115, a cool core cluster
%with no documented merger activity, with higher pressure at large radii in the SZ relative to X-rays could likely 
%be explained by the geometry in the plane of the sky. MACS 1115 shows a northern elongation in the Bolocam map that 
%is not present in the X-ray surface brightness maps (Figure~\ref{fig:mustang_maps_sample}), and MACS 0429 shows a 
%northwest-southeast elongation that is not evident in the X-ray surface brightness maps. Thus, there is a geometric 
%discrepancy between the SZ and X-ray, especially at moderate to large radii.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We developed an algorithm to jointly fit gNFW pressure profiles to clusters observed via the SZ
effect with MUSTANG and Bolocam. We apply this algorithm to 14 clusters and find the profiles are 
consistent with a universal pressure profile found in \citet{arnaud2010}. Specifically, the 
pressure profile is of the form:
\begin{equation*}
  \Tilde{P_e} = \frac{P_0}{(C_{500} X)^{\gamma} [1 + (C_{500} X)^{\alpha}]^{(\beta - \gamma)/\alpha}},
%  \label{eqn:norm_gnfw}
\end{equation*}
where we fixed $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to values found in \citet{arnaud2010}. A comparison to previous
determinations of pressure profiles is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pp_sets}. Within the radii where we
have the greatest constraints ($0.03 R_{500} \lesssim r \lesssim R_{500}$), the pressure profile from this
work is comparable to the other pressure profiles. This is further evidenced in the parameters themselves,
as seen in Table~\ref{tbl:pressure_profile_results}, especially in comparison to \citetalias{arnaud2010} parameter values.

Despite agreement for the ensemble constraint, we found discrepancies between the SZ and X-ray derived
pressure profiles for individual clusters and investigated the potential to explain these discrepancies
as being due to cluster geometry and ICM temperature (Section~\ref{sec:xray_comp}). We investigate cluster
geometry by looking at the ratio between spherically derived pressure profiles as fit to SZ and ACCEPT data 
and we find that the clusters have plane of axis ratios, $c$, tabulated in 
Table~\ref{tbl:accept_gnfw}, which are generally greater than unity, implying that most of these clusters are 
elongated along the line of sight. We extend this analysis to estimate the relative cluster geometry
in the core (from MUSTANG), compared to the larger scale ICM (from Bolocam) and we find some 
hint that the cores tend to be more spherical than the ICM at larger radii. 
%\textcolor{red}{larger scale ICM}. However, our assumption is that the
%cluster geometry is one (or two) ellipsoids and this only explains a scalar offset in the pressure profiles.

In contrast, discrepancies due to electron temperature can account for differences with cluster-centric radii.
To explain the discrepancies we see, the ICM temperatures would need to be higher than derived by 
spectroscopic X-ray data by ACCEPT. These higher temperatures are also biased towards larger radii, which is 
plausible observationally as X-ray measurements would be less sensitive in regions of lower density.

We conclude that cluster geometry and ICM temperature are likely critical in accounting for the differences
between SZ and X-ray derived pressure profiles. However, we do not believe that either of these (with
strict ellipsoids) are sufficient to explain the differences observed. We postulate that deviations from
the ellipsoidal geometry, such as geometry in the plane of the sky as seen, for example, in MACS 1115
(Figure~\ref{fig:mustang_maps_sample}), will also be important in explaining the discrepancies observed.

%We tabulate two temperatures derived for the 
%clusters from ACCEPT \citep{cavagnolo2009} and \citet{morandi2015}: $T_X^1$ is calculated from a single spectrum over 
%$0.15 R_{500} < r < R_{500}$ for each cluster. $T_X^2$ is from \citet{morandi2015} and is calculated over 
%$0.15 R_{500} < r < 0.75 R_{500}$.  Additionally, we calculate $T_{mg}$, by fitting the ACCEPT 
%temperature profiles to the profile found in \citet{vikhlinin2006}. We then tabulate
%$T_{spec}$ as $T_{spec} = 1.11 \times T_{mg}$ given the ratio found in \citet{vikhlinin2006} between $T_{spec}$
%and $T_{mg}$. We may then compare either $T_x^1$ and $T_x^2$ to $T_{spec}$. Thus, we note that generally 
%$T_{spec} < T_{X}^1 \sim T_{X}^2$, which may indicate the ACCEPT pressure profiles may be biased low, relative 
%to the SZ pressure profiles by the deprojected (and interpolated) ACCEPT temperature profiles.

%These investigations of cluster geometry and electron temperatures may account for the discrepancy between
%SZ and X-ray pressure profiles. However, these investigations have been simplistic and are indicative of
%the global geometry and properties of the cluster (at all radii), with the exception that we have also found
%some indication of a difference in geometry between moderate-to-large radii and core. Yet, the discrepancy
%in pressure profiles is not simply a scalar offset, but that the shapes often differ, especially in that
%the SZ pressure profile is lower than X-ray in the cluster core, and SZ pressure is generally higher at
%large radii. Geometry in the plane of the sky may be able to account for this offset, as evidenced by
%MACS 1115, where an extended decrement to the north of the cluster center is seen by Bolocam, and drives the
%radial pressure up, whereas this extension does not appear in the X-ray surface brightness image.

%Finally, many of these clusters with discrepancies in pressure profiles have weak detections with 
%MUSTANG, and would benefit from additional high resolution observations. While this may not resolve the
%pressure difference at large radii, it could bring the pressure profile shape into greater alignment.

\label{sec:ind_notes}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Abell 1835 (z=0.25)}
\label{sec:results_a1835}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Abell 1835 is a well studied massive cool core cluster. The cool core was noted to have substructure in the central
10\asecs by \citet{schmidt2001}, and identified as being due the central AGN by \citet{mcnamara2006}. Abell 1835 has also
been extensively studied via the SZ effect \citep{reese2002,benson2004,bonamente2006,sayers2011,mauskopf2012}. The models adopted
were either beta models or generalized beta models, and tend to suggest a shallow slope for the pressure interior
to 10\asec. Previous analysis of Abell 1835 with MUSTANG data \citep{korngut2011} detected the SZ effect decrement, but not
at high significance, which is consistent with a featureless, smooth, broad signal. Our updated MUSTANG reduction
of Abell 1835, shown in Figure \ref{fig:mustang_maps_sample}, has the same features as in \citet{korngut2011}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Abell 611 (z=0.29)}
\label{sec:results_a611}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Abell 611 is unique among our clusters for the severity of the discrepancy between our joint SZ fitted pressure
profile and that found in the X-rays. The MUSTANG map (Figure~\ref{fig:mustang_maps_sample}) shows an enhancement
south of the X-ray centroid, and the Bolocam map shows elongation towards the south-southwest. Weak lensing maps
are suggestive of a southwest-northeast elongation \citep{newman2009, zitrin2015}.
Using the density of galaxies, \citet{lemze2013} find a core and a halo which align with the elongation seen 
in the SZ. We note that AMI
% I had a reference to (Figure~\ref{fig:a611_supp_figs})
\citep{hurley-walker2012} also sees this elongation, while they also note that Abell 611 is the most relaxed
cluster in their sample and that the X-ray data presented from \citet{laroque2006} is very circular and uniform.
Despite being relaxed, Abell 611 is not listed as a cool core cluster (nor disturbed) \citep{sayers2013}.

In an analysis of the dark matter distribution, \citet{newman2009} find that the core (logarithmic) slope of the
cluster is shallower than an NFW model, with $\beta_{DM} = 0.3$, where the dark matter distribution has been characterized
by yet another generalization of the NFW profile:
\begin{equation}
  \rho(r) = \frac{\rho_0}{(r/r_s)^{\beta_{tot}}(1 + r/r_s)^{3-\beta_{tot}}}
\end{equation}
They find the distribution of dark matter within Abell 611 to be inconsistent with a single NFW model. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{MACS 1115 (z=0.36)}
\label{sec:results_m1115}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

MACS 1115 is listed as a cool core cluster \citep{sayers2013}. It is among seven CLASH clusters that show
unambiguous ultraviolet (UV) excesses attributed to unabsorbed star formation rates of 5-80 $M_{\odot} $yr$^{-1}$
\citep{donahue2015}. MUSTANG detects a point source in MACS 1115, which is coincident with its BCG. 
%The NVSS, at 1.4 GHz, finds the flux of the point source to be $16.2$ mJy.
MACS 1115 is fit by a fairly steep inner pressure profile slope to the SZ data (Table~\ref{tbl:pressure_profile_results}).
Adopting the Bolocam centroid, the inner pressure profile slope is notably reduced, yet the goodness of fit is
not significantly changed. In particular, the Bolocam image shows a north-south elongation (particularly to the
north of the centroids). In contrast, weak and strong lensing \citep{zitrin2015} show a more southeast-northwest
elongation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{MACS 0429 (z=0.40)}
\label{sec:results_m0429}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

MACS 0429 has been well studied in the X-ray \citep{schmidt2007,comerford2007,maughan2008,allen2008,mann2012}
MACS 0429 is identified as a cool core cluster \citep[cf.][]{mann2012,sayers2013}. The bright point source in 
the MUSTANG image is the cluster BCG, which is noted as having an excesses UV emission \citep{donahue2015}.
Of the point sources observed by MUSTANG, this has the shallowest spectral index between 90 GHz and 140 GHz
of $\alpha_{\nu} = 0.55$.
%At 90 GHz, we find the flux density as $7.67 \pm 0.84$ mJy. The point source subtracted from the Bolocam data
%is a $6.0 \pm 1.8$ mJy source at 140 GHz. At 1.4 GHz, NVSS finds the point source to have a flux density of
%$138.8 \pm 4.2$ mJy \citep{condon1998}. 

Despite MACS 0429's stature as a cool core cluster, its pressure profile
(Table~\ref{tbl:pressure_profile_results}) is surprisingly shallow in the core, and shows elevated pressure relative to
X-ray derived pressure at moderate radii. The offset between the Bolocam centroid \citep{sayers2013} and ACCEPT
\citep{cavagnolo2009} centroid is 100 kpc, which is notably larger than the X-ray-optical separations of the cluster
peaks and centroids reported in \citet{mann2012} of 12.8 and 19.5 kpc respectively.

\subsection{MACS 1206 (z=0.44)}
\label{sec:results_m1206}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

MACS 1206 has been observed extensively \citep[e.g.][]{ebeling2001,ebeling2009,gilmour2009,umetsu2012,
zitrin2012a,biviano2013,sayers2013}. It is not categorized as a cool core or a disturbed cluster
\citep{sayers2013}. Using weak lensing data from Subaru, \citet{umetsu2012} find that the major-minor 
axis ratio of projected mass is $\gtrsim 1.7$ at $1\sigma$. They infer that this high ellipticity and 
alignment with the BCG, optical, X-ray, and LSS shapes are suggestive that the major axis is aligned 
close to the plane of the sky. In \citet{young2014}, substructure is identified that corresponds to an 
optically-identified subcluster, which may either be a merging subcluster, or a foreground cluster. 
In this analysis, the SZ signal observed by MUSTANG is well modelled by a residual component (coincident 
with the subcluster) and a spherical bulk ICM component. We note that the Bolocam contours of MACS 1206
do not exhibit much ellipticity. We do find that MACS 1206 has a major-minor axis 
ratio of $1.86 \pm 0.43$ (Table~\ref{tbl:accept_gnfw}), where the major axis is along the line of sight.

%The point source was found to have a flux density of $0.77 \pm 0.06$ mJy with the best fit model in
%\citet{young2014}. In this analysis, we find it to have a flux density of $0.75 \pm 0.08$ mJy. A proposal 
%has been accepted for \emph{XMM-Newton} observations of this substructure (PI: Sarazin).

\subsection{MACS 0329 (z=0.45)}
\label{sec:results_m0329}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

MACS 0329 has the distinction of being listed as both a cool core and disturbed cluster. Although it has
been classified as relaxed \citep{schmidt2007}, subtructure has been noted \citep{maughan2008}, and it earns
its cool core and disturbed classifications based on central weighting of X-ray luminsoity and comparing
centroid offsets between optical and X-ray data \citep{sayers2013}. The elongation of the weak lensing and
strong lensing are towards the northwest and southeast of the centroid.

MACS 0329 has two systems with multiple images: one at $z = 6.18$ and the other at $z = 2.17$. The Einstein
radii for these two systems are $r_E = 34$\asecs and $r_E = 28$\asec, respectively \citep{zitrin2012b}, which is
noted as being typical for relaxed, well-concentrated lensing clusters.

\subsection{RXJ1347 (z=0.45)}
\label{sec:results_rxj1347}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

RXJ1347 is one of the most luminous X-ray clusters, and has been well studied in radio, SZ, lensing, optical
spectroscopy, and X-rays \citep[e.g.][]{schindler1995,allen2002, pointecouteau1999,komatsu2001,kitayama2004,
gitti2007b,ota2008,bradac2008,miranda2008}. X-ray contours have long suggested RXJ1347 is a relaxed system
\citep[e.g.][]{schindler1997}, and it is classified as a cool core cluster \citep[e.g.][]{mann2012,sayers2013}. 

Indeed, the first sub-arcminute SZ observations \citep{komatsu2001,kitayama2004} saw an enhancement to
the southeast of the cluster X-ray peak, which was suggested as being due to shock heating. This enhancement
was confirmed by MUSTANG \citep{mason2010}. Further measurements were made with CARMA \citep{plagge2013},
which find the 9\% of the thermal energy in the cluster is in sub-arcminute substructure.
At low radio frequencies \citep[][237 MHz and 614 MHz]{ferrari2011},
\citep[][1.4 GHz]{gitti2007a} find evidence for a radio mini-halo in the core of RXJ1347. The cosmic ray electrons
are thought to be reaccelerated because of the shock and sloshing in the cluster \citep{ferrari2011}.

We observe a point source (coincident with the BCG) with flux density of $7.40 \pm 0.58$ mJy. Previous analysis of 
the MUSTANG data found the point source flux density as 5 mJy \citep{mason2010}. The difference in the flux 
densities is likely accounted by (1) the different modeling of point sources; primarily that we filter the double 
Gaussian, (2) we simultaneously fit the components, and (3) we assume a steeper profile in the core than the beta 
model assumed in \citet{mason2010}. Lower frequency radio observations found the flux density of the source to be 
$10.81 \pm 0.19$ mJy at 28.5 GHz \citep{reese2002}, and $47.6 \pm 1.9$ mJy at 1.4 GHz \citep{condon1998}. The BCG 
is observed to have a UV excess\citep{donahue2015}. 

Despite
the classification of being a cool core cluster, it is also observed that there are hot regions, intially
constrained as $kT > 10$ keV \citep[e.g.][]{allen2002,bradac2008}, and more recently constrained to even
hotter temperatures \citep[$kT > 20$ keV][]{johnson2012}, indicative of an unrelaxed cluster. 
\citet{johnson2012} also interpret the two cold fronts as being due to sloshing, where a subscluster has returned
for a second passage.

\subsection{MACS 1311 (z=0.49)}
\label{sec:results_m1311}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


MACS 1311 is listed as a cool core cluster \citep[e.g.][]{sayers2013}, and appears to have quite circular
contours in the X-ray and lensing images, yet has evidence for some disturbance, given its classification
in \citet{mann2012}. However, the SZ contours from Bolocam show some enhancement  to the west, and has
a notable centroid shift ($27.7$\asec) westward from the X-ray centroid. When fitting pressure profiles
to this cluster, it appears that the enhanced SZ pressure at moderate radii ($r \sim 100$\asec) is due
to this enhancement, especially when noting that we use the X-ray centroid. Adopting the Bolocam centroid
does not change the pressure profile much, and we still observe a pressure enhancement at moderate radii.

\subsection{MACS 1423 (z=0.54)}
\label{sec:results_m1423}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

MACS 1423 is a cool core cluster \citep{mann2012,sayers2013}. While the Bolocam contours are quite concentric,
and suggestive of a relaxed cluster, the centroid is still offset from the X-ray peak by an appreciable angle 
($19.8$\asec). Similar to MACS 1311, the pressure is slightly less than the ACCEPT X-ray derived pressure in the
core, and slightly greater at moderate radii. While this is expected for a centroid offset, we find that adopting
the Bolocam centroid again yields no substantial difference in the SZ pressure profile. We observe a point source 
(the cluster BCG) with flux density of $1.36 \pm 0.13$ mJy, which is also observed to have a UV excess 
\citep{donahue2015}.

\subsection{MACS 1149 (z=0.54)}
\label{sec:results_m1149}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

MACS 1149 is classified as a disturbed cluster \citep[e.g.][]{mann2012,sayers2013}, and lensing studies have found
that a single DM halo does not describe the cluster well, but rather at least four large-scale DM hales are used to
describe the cluster \citep{smith2009}. A large radial velocity dispersion \citep[1800 km s$^{-1}$][]{ebeling2007} is 
observed, indicative of merger activity along the line of sight. X-ray, SZ, and lensing (particularly 
strong lensing) all show elongation in the northwest-southeast direction. We see a $3\sigma$ feature to the east of
the centroids, but it is not clear that this is associated with any particular feature.

The SZ derived pressure profile roughly matches the shape of the X-ray derived pressure profile, 
with the SZ pressure consistently greater than the X-ray pressure.We calculate
that the axis along the line of sight is $2.08 \pm 0.52$ (Section~\ref{sec:ellgeo}) times greater than the axes in the plane
of the sky. Although we do not find previous analysis of the elongation in the plane of the sky, we would certainly
expect this given (1) the inferred merger activity along the line of sight, and (2) the lensing strength of the cluster.

%  \label{fig:m0717_mroczkowski}
%\end{figure}

Despite MACS 1149's impressive merging activity, MACS 0717 holds the title as the most disturbed massive cluster at $z> 0.5$
\citep{ebeling2007}, which appears to be accreting matter along a 6-Mpc-long filament \citep{ebeling2004}, and has the
largest known Einstein radius \citep[$\theta_e \sim 55$\asec;][]{zitrin2009}. Four distinct components are identified
from X-ray and optical analyses \citep{ma2009}, and the lensing analyses \citep{zitrin2009,limousin2012} find agreement
in the location of these four mass peaks with those from the X-ray and optical. 

%%% Rework (subclusters, but without figure...?)
%The four components are labelled in Figure~\ref{fig:m0717_mroczkowski}. 
There are four identified subclusters \citep[labeled A through D][]{ma2009}. They find that subcluster C is the
most massive component, while subcluster A is the least massive, and subclusters B and D are likely remnant cores. The
velocities of the components from spectroscopy are found to be $(v_A, v_B, v_C, v_D) = (+278_{-339}^{+295},+3238_{-242}^{+252},
-733_{-478}^{+486},+831_{-800}^{+843})$ km s$^{-1}$ \citep{ma2009}. 

MACS 0717 has also been observed at 610 MHz with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) which reveals both a radio
halo and a radio relic \citep{vanweeren2009}. This is interpreted as likely being due to a diffuse shock acceleration
(DSA).

We observe a foreground radio galaxy, modeled as a point source here, with flux density of $2.08 \pm 0.25$ mJy at 90 GHz. 
This was previously reported with an integrated flux density of $2.8 \pm 0.2$ mJy and an extended shape 
14.\asec4 $\times$ 16.\asec1 \citep{mroczkowski2012}. However, an improved beam modeling has allowed us to model the 
foreground galaxy given a known beam shape. It is also worth noting that the MUSTANG data itself has been processed 
slightly differently from that presented in \citet{mroczkowski2012}; in this work the map is produced with a common 
calculated as the mean across detectors, whereas in \citet{mroczkowski2012} the common mode was calculated as the 
median across detectors.

\subsection{MACS 0647 (z=0.59)}
\label{sec:results_m0647}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

MACS 0647 is at $z = 0.591$ and is classified as neither a cool core nor a disturbed cluster \citep{sayers2013}. 
It was included in the CLASH sample due to its strong lensing properties \citep{postman2012}.
Gravitational lensing \citep{zitrin2011}, X-ray surface brightness \citep{mann2012}, 
and SZ effect (MUSTANG, see Figure \ref{fig:mustang_maps_sample}, and Bolocam) maps all
show elongation in an east-west direction. 
In the joint analysis presented here, we see that the spherical model provides an adequate fit to both datasets and we note 
that the spherical assumption allows for a easier interpretation of the mass profile of the cluster.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{MACS 0744 (z=0.70)}
\label{sec:results_m0744}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

MACS 0744 is neither classified as a cool core cluster nor a disturbed cluster \citep{mann2012,sayers2013}, but qualifies
as a relaxed cluster \citep{mann2012}. There is a dense X-ray core, and a doubly peaked red sequence of galaxies as found
by \citet{kartaltepe2008}. The gas is also found to be rather hot: $k_B T_e = 17.9_{-3.4}^{+10.8}$ keV, as determined by combining
SZ and X-ray data \citep{laroque2003}. 

The data presented here is the same as in \citet{korngut2011}, but has been processed differently: again, the primary difference
is in the treatment of the common mode. Additionally, \citet{korngut2011} optimize over the low-pass filtering of the common mode
and do not implement a correction factor for the SNR map. The surface brightness significance of the shock feature is the same, 
but is perhaps less
bowed than the kidney bean shape seen previously.  The excess in \citet{korngut2011} was an exciting results for MUSTANG, 
as it marked the first clear detection of a shock in the SZ that had not been previously been known from X-ray observations. 
\citet{korngut2011}
reanalyze the X-ray data with the knowledge of the shocked region from MUSTANG, and calculate the Mach number of the shock
based on (1) the shock density jump, (2) stagnation condition between the pressures at the edge of the cold front and just
ahead of the shock, and (3) temperature jump across the shock, and find Mach numbers between 1.2 and 2.1, with a velocity of 
$1827_{-195}^{+267}$ km s$^{-1}$. The shocked region (region II in \citet{korngut2011}) is well modelled with $19.7$ keV gas.

\subsection{CLJ 1226 (z=0.89)}
\label{sec:results_clj1226}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

CLJ 1226 is a well studied high redshift cluster \citep[e.g.][]{mroczkowski2009,bulbul2010,adam2015}. 
\citet{adam2015} find a point source at RA 12:12:00.01 and Dec +33:32:42 with a flux density of 
$6.8 \pm 0.7 \text{ (stat.)} \pm 1.0 \text{ (cal.)}$ mJy at 260 GHz and $1.9 \pm 0.2 \text{ (stat.)}$ at 150 GHz. 
This is not the same point source seen in \citet{korngut2011}, which is reported as a point source
with $4.6\sigma$ significance in surface brightness, and can be fit in our current analysis as a point source 
with a flux density of $0.33 \pm 0.13$ mJy. A short VLA filler observation (VLA-12A-340, D-array, at 7 GHz) 
was performed to follow up this potential source. To a limit of $\sim 50 {\rm \mu Jy}$ nothing is seen, 
other than the clearly spatially distinct radio source associated with the BCG at the cluster center 
(1 mJy at 7 GHz and 3.2 mJy in NVSS). In contrast, the point source found in \citet{adam2015} is fit to our 
data with a flux density of $0.36 \pm 0.11$ mJy. Given the slight increase in significance of the point source
from \citet{adam2015}, we adopt that point source location for our pressure profile analysis of CLJ 1226.
 
%%% K09 flux is 0.34 +/- 0.13 mJy in our maps. Now I've written it in. Jan 2016.

In the previous analysis of the MUSTANG data, \citet{korngut2011} find a ridge of significant substructure after 
subtracting a bulk SZ profile (N07, fitted to SZA data). They find that this ridge, southwest of the cluster
center, alongside X-ray profiles, are consistent with a merger scenario. However, in this work, we do not find
any significant substructure after fitting a bulk component.
%\textcolor{red}{[I will do an analysis with the point source found in Korngut+2011. The question is if I already 
%have the point source modelled (and to find it).}

\section{Data Products}

We have made MUSTANG data products for the sample of clusters analysed in this paper available at: 
\protect{\url{https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/GB/Pennarray/MUSTANG_CLASH}}. Links to accompanying
Bolocam and ACCEPT data are available from this website as well. In particular, we have publicized the final
data maps, noise maps, and signal-to-noise (SNR) maps used in this analysis, as well as transfer functions
for individual clusters. Further documentation is available on the website.
